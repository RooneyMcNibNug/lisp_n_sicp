# lisp_n_sicp

### PREFACE

I never went to school for "computer scince". I majored in journalism and poli-sci.

Fast forward, many years later, doing tons of sysadmin work. Working pretty consistently on wrangling data, machines, pushing down with things like bash, powershell, ansible, chef, and eventually some perl.

But there is this pining inside me for really diving into fundamental pieces of programming, and looking at something old but new.

Over the holiday's I randomly dive into rabbitholes pertaining to the lisp programming language on mastodon - I find some heavy emacs users and people developing indie games and when I look at their lisp, scheme, clojure code something sparks there - a desire to learn more.

I buy somehwat chewed-up copy old copy of a Lisp book by Guy Steele (more on this later). Its perplexing fuel. I start getting my hands dirty with the CLISP REPL. 

But I want to pair this with something

### AGENDA

I am going to venture forward into learning Lisp and exploring functional programming by doing the following:

1. Reading through a copy of  Hal Abelson's, Jerry Sussman's and Julie Sussman's _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_
2. Watching some of the original Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs video lectures
3. Reading through Lisp gaming books (nostarch)
4. Working on excercises from all of the aformnetioned resources
5. Maybe even working on some silly code (and with something like emacs) as I go along supplimentally
