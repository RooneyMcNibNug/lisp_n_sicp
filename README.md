# lisp_n_sicp

### PREFACE

I never went to school for "computer science". At the university I majored in journalism and poli-sci.

Fast forward, many years later, doing tons of sysadmin work. Working pretty consistently on wrangling data, machines, pushing down with things like bash, powershell, ansible, chef, and eventually some perl.

But there is a spark inside me for really diving into fundamental pieces of programming, and looking at something different.

Over the holidays I randomly threw myself into some rabbitholes pertaining to the Lisp programming language - I randomly find some heavy emacs users on Mastodon and people developing indie games. When I look at their lisp, scheme, clojure code something sparks there - a desire to learn more.

I buy somehwat chewed-up copy old copy of a Lisp book by Guy Steele (more on this later). Its perplexing fuel. I start getting my hands dirty with the CLISP REPL. 

But I want to pair this with something larger - a deeper understanding of this type of programming. 

It turns out there are some really great resources for this that use Lisp as their examples.

And so I formulate a plan..

### AGENDA

I am going to venture forward into learning Lisp and exploring functional programming by doing the following:

1. Reading through a copy of _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_
2. Watching some of the original Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs video lectures
3. Reading through Lisp gaming books (nostarch)
4. Working on excercises from all of the aformnetioned resources
5. Maybe even working on some silly code (and with something like emacs) as I go along supplimentally

I will probably feel confused. Probably fail a few times. But I think it will be a beneficial experience and a diving into the deepend of something that seem to have stood the test of time.
